"Wow, it's great that Food Network have all these old Good Eats episode on their website, but why are they all postage-stamp sized?"

Well, now they're not.

## Requirements
You'll need a browser which can run extensions, as well as a browser extension that can run user scripts. As of 07/18, [I recommend never installing Stylish](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/stylish-extension-with-2m-downloads-banished-for-tracking-every-site-visit/), and [instead using Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html). 

## Caveats
I'm still on the first season so if this bad boy switches to 16:9 midstream I will need to do some adjusting. Man, remember the 90's?
